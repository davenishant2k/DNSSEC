# DNSSEC
This is my complete implementation of DNSSEC (Secured DNS) using Python. This project was performed by me as a part of "Fundamentals of Computer Networks - CSE 534" course that I had taken in my Masters in Computer Science (MS CS) at SUNY Stony Brook University.

To run the DNSSEC, use the following command:


python DNSSEC.py <Domain Name> <DNS Lookup Type>
  or
python3 DNSSEC.py <Domain Name> <DNS Lookup Type>
 
For example:
  
python3 DNSSEC.py www.google.com A
